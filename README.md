Dai CLI - AI‑Backed Dependency Upgrade Advisor

An open‑source CLI tool that automates dependency maintenance by scanning your project, detecting outdated or vulnerable packages, and using AI to draft upgrade rationales and PRs.

🚀 Features

Scan & Report: Parse your package.json (and lockfile) to list direct and transitive dependencies with current versions.

Vulnerability Detection: Integrate with GitHub Advisory Database and NVD feeds to flag security issues.

Smart Upgrade Suggestions: Compute minimal semver bumps and use an LLM to generate:

What changed: Summary of version differences.

Why: Rationale including vulnerability fixes and improvements.

Migration notes: Highlight breaking changes and upgrade steps.

PR Automation: Apply version updates and open draft pull requests on GitHub with autogenerated title, diff, and AI‑written description.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Core Engine: Node.js + TypeScript

Dependency parsing: @npmcli/arborist

Semver logic: semver

Security data: GitHub REST API, NVD JSON feeds

AI Integration: OpenAI GPT‑4 API for summarizing changelogs and drafting PR descriptions

CLI Development:

Go (recommended): Rapid compilation to a single, beautiful binary; rich standard library for CLI UX (e.g. spf13/cobra).

Rust (alternative): High performance and safety; use structopt/clap for ergonomic CLI parsing.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions to schedule scans or trigger on push/PR events
